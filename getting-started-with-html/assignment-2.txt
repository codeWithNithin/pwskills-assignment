2. Explain the purpose of comments in HTML and provide an example of how to use comments in HTML document?.
ans:  Purpose of comments in HTML document is to add the explanation of code or to hide a part of code in HTML document that should not render  in browser.

for example, we use <!-- --> to comment single line and multi line of html code.

we can add a explanation of code as well
<!-- Write a simple program in HTML that displays the heading HTML defines the Content and structure of your website on the browser -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Assignment 1</title>
  </head>
  <body>

This is a single line comment
<!-- <h2>Assignment 2</h2> -->

This is how we add a multiline comment
<!-- <h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
<h3>Assignment 3</h3> -->

<h1>HTML defines the Content and structure of your website</h1>
  </body>
</html>
