4.Write a short note on tag and element with an example?
Ans:
 Tag:
 a tag in html describes how the content is described. for example p, h1, h2, h3, strong etc...
Each tag has a opening tag and a closing tag. some of the tags can be self closing tags.


HTML Element:
basically HTML element consists of 3 parts, opening tag, content and a closing tag.

an opening tag is represented as <>.
an closing tag is represented as </>
content can be a text, img or an child element

for example: if i have to use the paragraph element then
<p> This is the paragraph </p>.

<p> --> opening tag.
This is the paragraph --> content
</p> --> closing tag
